        <h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p>
            Linked Research is the new black. A paper written in PDF is so last century.
            With Linked Research, you can create much richer references to other articles, which this plug-in is intended for.
            
          </p><p>
            Afraid that your references won't be indexed by the common crawlers today?
            No worries, thanks to the fact that we just print normal references anyway, this should not be a problem.
            However, the crawlers really should learn how to use Linked Data, and the more of us that will start annotating or papers with Linked Data the more this will start happening.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Jekyll is a static site generator. It allows you to program a couple of rules in order to generate your HTML pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bibliographic references in [RDFa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa) using the [cito vocabulary](http:/purl.org/spar/cito/) and the [bibo ontology](http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/)
        </p><p>
This makes sure you can write papers, blog posts or books in HTML using jekyll to generate the references for you by describing the references once in a [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org) file.

          <li><a href="https://dokie.li/">dokieli</a> - an amazing editor that even has 
          <li><a href="https://github.com/essepuntato/rash">RASH</a> - using these stylesheets and javascript, you will be able to generate LNCS and ACM template without any issues.

        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>
          See <a href="https://github.com/pietercolpaert/jekyll-refs">the README.md on our github repository</a> to see it in action.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          We can now have references that work on the web with a similar convenience to the latex workflow.
          e.g., check out us citing the {% sc citesAsAuthority https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180 %}<abbr title="Comma-Separated Values">csv</abbr> spec{% ec %}.
